This repository contains the data and scripts used to conduct the genomic and phenotypic analyses for this study. The project is organized to clearly separate input data, analysis code, and derived outputs, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and ease of reuse.
Repository structure
SNP_fil : This directory contains single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data for all genotypes included in the study. These marker datasets are used as input for genomic and phenomic analyses and form the basis for relationship matrix construction and downstream prediction models.
BLUE_fil: This directory contains best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) for each genotype. The BLUEs were obtained from statistical models accounting for experimental design and environmental effects and are used as phenotypic inputs for genomic and phenomic prediction analyses.
Scripts_repo: This directory contains the complete analysis pipeline used in this study. The scripts are organized to run the analyses in a structured and reproducible manner, including data preprocessing, model fitting, validation, and result generation. Together, these scripts allow users to reproduce all analyses presented in the study.
